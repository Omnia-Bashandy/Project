# Endangered Animal System

## Overview

The **Endangered Animal System** is a project aimed at monitoring the health and well-being of endangered animals. The system uses hardware sensors to collect vital data such as heart rate and temperature from the animals. This data is then transmitted to a React-based web application, where it can be viewed and analyzed in real-time, providing conservationists and researchers with crucial information to track and protect endangered species.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Collection:** Monitors heart rate and temperature of endangered animals.
- **React Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface to view and track the health metrics of monitored animals.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphical representation of collected data for better analysis.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Generates alerts when abnormal data readings are detected.

## Hardware Components

- **Heart Rate Sensor:** Used to measure the animal's heart rate.
- **Temperature Sensor:** Used to measure the animal's body temperature.
- **Microcontroller:** Acts as the central processing unit, collecting data from the sensors and transmitting it to the server.
- **Wireless Module:** Transmits data to the web server using Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

## Software Components

### Backend

- **Data Collection Script:** A Python (or relevant language) script running on the microcontroller, responsible for reading sensor data and sending it to the server.
- **API Server:** A backend server (Node.js, Python Flask, etc.) that receives data from the microcontroller, stores it in a database, and makes it available to the frontend via RESTful APIs.

### Frontend

- **React Web Application:** A dynamic and responsive web app built using React.js. It displays real-time data, historical data trends, and alerts related to the animals' health.
- **Charting Library:** Used for visualizing the data (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js).

## Installation and Setup

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the heart rate sensor and temperature sensor to the microcontroller according to the hardware schematics.
2. Ensure the wireless module is properly connected and configured to communicate with the web server.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/endangered-animal-system-backend.git
   cd endangered-animal-system-backend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the API server with the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).
4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/endangered-animal-system-frontend.git
   cd endangered-animal-system-frontend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the frontend with the API endpoint of the backend server.
4. Run the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. After setting up both the hardware and software, power on the microcontroller.
2. The data collected from the sensors will be sent to the backend server and stored in the database.
3. Access the React web application via your browser to view the real-time and historical data.
4. Monitor alerts and notifications for any abnormal readings.
